						Tells your browser that there is a body section. 
						<li class="neon-green-text bg-black"> "< body> < /body>"</li>
						Tells your browser that there is heading1, heading2,... heading6. Heading1 is the largest and Heading6 is the smallest
						<li class="neon-green-text bg-black"> "< h1> This is where your heading goes < /h1>" </li>
						<li class="neon-green-text bg-black"> "< h2> This is where your heading goes < /h2>" </li>
						<li class="neon-green-text bg-black"> "< h3> This is where your heading goes < /h3>" </li>
						<li class="neon-green-text bg-black"> "< h6> This is where your heading goes < /h6>" </li>
						Tells your browser that there is a paragraph.
						<li class="neon-green-text bg-black"> "< p> This is where your paragraph goes < /p>"</li>

			<h1 class="center-text"> The life of a software developer </h1>
			<img class="img-width-150 img-height-150 center-img" src="resources/images/simpson.gif">
			<p class="center-text">
				First off, if you are a software developer or learning how to code. Give yourself a pat in the back. Seriously. <br/> 
				<i class="fade-in-infinite-text-animation"> You are awesome! </i> <br/> 
				<i class="fade-in-infinite-text-animation"> Don't ever forget that! </i> <br/>
				So, what is a software developer? <br />
				A software developer is someone who creates computer software including the design and testing of a software such as mobile apps, desktop apps, or websites. <br/>
				An example will be this website that I designed and created for you. <br/>
				Being a software developer is a talented skill to have and requires a shit ton of patience and perseverance. It also requires you to be detail oriented and have a passion for technology. <br/>
				I also want to mention that at some point in your life you might be discouraged to learn how to code or have self doubt in your software career. <br/>
				This is normal. As a matter of fact many programmers face imposter syndrome at some point in his or her life. So, please do <b> not </b> be discouraged. <br/>
				<i class="fade-in-infinite-text-animation"> You are never too late to start learning how to code. </i> <br/> 
				<i class="fade-in-infinite-text-animation"> Just remember nobody in this world cannot take away your knowledge. </i> <br/>
				Lastly, tech is changing rapidly and many programmers must upgrade his or her skills in order to stay competitive and up to date in the software industry. <br/>

			<h1 class="center-text"> Tips for future and current college students </h1>
			<p class="center-text">
				Is college worth it? That is probably what you want to know. <br/>
				Well, this depends on what you are pursuing. But college is worth investing if you are pursuing engineering, computer science, teaching, doctor, nurse, business, or anything related to STEM. <br/>
				However, just because you major in the following field does not entitle you with a job in your career. <br/>
				The market is SATURATED with many youngster with a degree and the market is  COMPETITIVE for any degree you achieve. <br />
				You must distinguish yourself from others and figure out how to stand out. <br/> 
				However, college can help you and give you that extra boost in your career but nothing is guaranteed. <br/> 
				Best advice I can give you is to find internships and apply everywhere. <br/> Literally everywhere!! <br/>
				Internships is where you will network with people in your field. This will be a pedestal in your career. <br/>
				Find your passion in college and take classes you are highly passionate about. <br/>
				<i class="fade-in-infinite-text-animation"> The greater the passion you have for a subject, the more self-driven you will become even if the odds are against you. </i><br/>
				<i class="fade-in-infinite-text-animation"> Your passion will be similar to falling in love. </i> <br/> 
				Do not major in a field because is easy or it will make you a ton of money. You will not be happy and you are just hurting yourself in the long term. Focus on your passion and the money will follow. <br/>
				I will highly encourage you to find a backup plan just in case college does not go as what you expect. Start your own side hustle in what you are passionate about.
				<br/> 
				<i class="fade-in-infinite-text-animation"> 
				You do not need college to be successful. </i> <br/>
				<b class="fade-in-infinite-text-animation"> EXPERIENCE > DEGREE </b> <br/>
				You just need to be passionate about a field that you are an expert and build a business around your passion. <br/>
				<i class="fade-in-infinite-text-animation"> Best of luck. </i> <br/>

			<h1 class="center-text"> Read if you are majoring in Computer Science </h1>
			<p class="center-text">
				There is too much hype in this field. So, let me start off by stating the truth about majoring in Computer Science <br/>
				First off, if you have a delusional mentality about how rich you will be after graduating then pursuing this field is like running into a brick wall. üòÖ <br/>
				Studying computer science requires <i class="fade-in-infinite-text-animation"> hard work! </i> <br/>
				There is <b> no luck </b> in this field. <br/>
				You must have a deep passion for technology. <br/>
				<i class="fade-in-infinite-text-animation"> Like I said before, the greater the passion you have, the more self-driven you will become even if the odds are against you. </i><br/>
				<i class="fade-in-infinite-text-animation"> You must be an over achiever if you really want to be a software engineer. </i> <br/>
				Do you think I am exaggerating? üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ <br/>
				Let me explain why you think I might be exaggerating. Most school focuses on the theoretical concept of computer science. <br/>
				Of course, this is critical and highly important because without it you cannot proceed into learning how to code. <br/>
				But, learning theory is not enough to be employed as a software engineer. <br/>
				<i class="fade-in-infinite-text-animation"> You <b> must </b> create your own self project outside of school in order to prove the world that you are good enough. </i>
				<br/>
				This means developing projects for free. Yes, FREE! <br/>
				This means grinding past midnight and creating your own self projects instead of just doing the minimal amount of work. <br/>
				<i class="fade-in-infinite-text-animation"> The best programmers tend to be hobbyist because he or she creates software at an every day basis. </i> <br/>
				Do not be discouraged though. If you have a deep passion for technology nothing will stop you. <br/>
				Welcome to the programmer's world.

			<h1 class="center-text"> Why you should fail more often </h1>
			<p class="center-text fade-in-infinite-text-animation">
				The faster you fail the higher chance you will succeed. <br/>
			</p> 
			<p class="center-text">
				Let's be honest. Failing sucks! But you can learn from your failures and enable yourself to think wisely and intelligently. Failures applies to everything in life not just school. <br/>
				<i class="fade-in-infinite-text-animation"> Learn to embrace failure. </i> <br/>
				This will take some time to get use to because as a human beings we tend to fear change. We tend to avoid change. We fear rejection. <br/>
				In simple terms, you cannot be successful or want to be successful without taking the failures. <br/>
				You must learn to love failure. <br/>
				You must love eating the dirt in order to reach your end goal. <br/>
				Do not take failure as a pessimistic view and give up because of it. <br/>
				I have failed in many things in my life. This blog has a high chance of failing. But, I'm still creating this blog because I can still learn something from it. I can probably help someone out who is reading this. Besides, I'm learning to code and building up my portfolio. <br/>
				So, basically Im killing two birds with one stone. <br/>
				Take care. üòÅ

			<h1 class="center-text"> How to overcome depression, anxiety, or loneliness </h1>
			<p class="center-text">
				If you are reading this, I just want to let you know you are not alone. <br/>
				I also want to let you know that this feeling is only temporary and only you have the ability to change it. <br/>
				You may feel a lot of pressure in today's society. <br/>
				I do too! Believe me. <br/>
				I believe many of you who are going through this are mentally beating yourself up. 
				<br/>
				Take a break. Go out for a walk. <br/>
				<i class="center-text fade-in-infinite-text-animation"> Refresh your mind. </i> 
				<br/>
				It is going to be OK. üëå üëå <br/>
				Keep trying and never give up! <br/>
				Be patient in whatever you are trying to accomplish. <br/>
				Stop comparing yourself to others. Life is not a race. <br/>
				Focus on building yourself. Focus on self improving yourself. <br/>
				Social media may be tackling your emotions by seeing someone flexing. <br/>
				But who cares!! <br/> Social media is only a 1 dimension world! <br/>
				Follow your dreams and passion. <br/>
				Life is hard and giving up will not solve anything and will only slow you down. 
				<br/>
				Keep persevering. <br/> It will all get better. üëå <br/>
				It is a marathon. Not a race. <br/> Take care of yourself üòé <br/>
